# workshop-javascript-introduction

Hi 👋 this repo was part of a small presentation by me. It basically introduced people into the modern world of the web development - mainly how to use javascript. To run the code samples you will need node installed on your local machine.

The presentation is also found as a pdf inside this repo (Only available in german 🙁)
